Really it comes down to this… do you love to solve mysteries?\n\tNow, I have a wealth of cases, most closed, but some still open, in my long career. What I’m going to do is try some of them out with you, and see how you do. I’ll just be sitting here, staying warm by the fire. Tell me when you want a mystery.";
